# Diagnosing Rules Issues<a name="diagnosing-rules"></a>

The best way to debug issues you are having with rules is to useCloudWatch Logs\. When you enable CloudWatch Logs for AWS IoT, you can see which rules are triggered and their success or failure\. You also get information about whether WHERE clause conditions match\. For more information, see [Monitoring with CloudWatch Logs](cloud-watch-logs.md)\. 

The most common rules issue is authorization\. The logs show if your role is not authorized to perform AssumeRole on the resource\. Here is an example log generated by [fine\-grained logging](cloud-watch-logs.md#fine-grained-logging):

```
{
    "timestamp": "2017-12-09 22:49:17.954",
    "logLevel": "ERROR",
    "traceId": "ff563525-6469-506a-e141-78d40375fc4e",
    "accountId": "123456789012",
    "status": "Failure",
    "eventType": "RuleExecution",

    "resources": {
        "ItemHashKeyField": "id",
        "Table": "trashbin",
        "Operation": "Insert",
        "ItemHashKeyValue": "id",
        "IsPayloadJSON": "true"
    },
    "principalId": "ABCDEFG1234567ABCD890:outis",
    "details": "User: arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/dynamo-testbin/5aUMInJH is not authorized to perform: dynamodb:PutItem on resource: arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/testbin (Service: AmazonDynamoDBv2; Status Code: 400; Error Code: AccessDeniedException; Request ID: AKQJ987654321AKQJ123456789AKQJ987654321AKQJ987654321)"
}
```

Here is a similar example log generated by [global logging](cloud-watch-logs.md#global-logging):

External services are controlled by the end user\. Before rule execution, make sure external services are set up with enough throughput and capacity units\.
