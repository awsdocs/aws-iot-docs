# Configure Your Device<a name="configure-iot"></a>

To communicate with AWS IoT Core, all devices must have a device certificate, private key, and root CA certificate installed\. Consult your device's documentation to connect to it and copy your device certificate, private key, and root CA certificate onto your device\. 

If you don't have an IoT\-ready device, you can use the MQTT client, the AWS IoT Device SDKs, or the AWS CLI\. For more information, see the [Using the AWS IoT Device SDKs on a Raspberry Pi](sdk-tutorials.md) section\. The tutorials use a Raspberry Pi, but can easily be adapted for use with other types of computers\.
