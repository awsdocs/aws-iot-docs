# Vulnerability analysis and management in AWS IoT Core<a name="vulnerability-analysis-and-management"></a>

IoT fleets can consist of large numbers of devices that have diverse capabilities, are long\-lived, and are geographically distributed\. These characteristics make fleet setup complex and error\-prone\. And because devices are often constrained in computational power, memory, and storage capabilities, this limits the use of encryption and other forms of security on the devices themselves\. Also, devices often use software with known vulnerabilities\. These factors make IoT fleets an attractive target for hackers and make it difficult to secure your device fleet on an ongoing basis\.

AWS IoT Device Defender addresses these challenges by providing tools to identify security issues and deviations from best practices\. You can use AWS IoT Device Defender to analyze, audit, and monitor connected devices to detect abnormal behavior, and mitigate security risks\. AWS IoT Device Defender can audit device fleets to ensure they adhere to security best practices and detect abnormal behavior on devices\. This makes it possible to enforce consistent security policies across your AWS IoT device fleet and respond quickly when devices are compromised\. For more information, see [AWS IoT Device Defender](device-defender.md)\.
