The AWS IoT Device SDKs help you to easily and quickly connect your devices to AWS IoT\. The AWS IoT Device SDKs include open\-source libraries, developer guides with samples, and porting guides so that you can build innovative IoT products or solutions on your choice of hardware platforms\.

**Note**  
Fleet provisioning \(beta\) is currently supported only in the AWS IoT Device SDK for Embedded C\.

## AWS Mobile SDK for Android<a name="iot-android-sdk"></a>

The AWS SDK for Android contains a library, samples, and documentation for developers to build connected mobile applications using AWS\. This SDK also includes support for calling AWS IoT APIs\. For more information, see the following:

## Arduino Yún SDK<a name="iot-arduino-sdk"></a>

The AWS IoT Arduino Yún SDK makes it possible for developers to connect their Arduino Yún\-compatible boards to AWS IoT\. By connecting a device to AWS IoT, users can securely work with the message broker, rules, and shadows provided by AWS IoT and with other AWS services like AWS Lambda, Kinesis, and Amazon S3\. For more information, see the following:

+ [Arduino Yún SDK Readme](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-arduino-yun/blob/master/README.md)

## AWS IoT Device SDK for Embedded C<a name="iot-c-sdk"></a>

The AWS IoT Device SDK for Embedded C is a collection of C source files that can be used in embedded applications to securely connect to the AWS IoT platform\. It includes transport clients, TLS implementations, and examples for their use\. It also supports AWS IoT\-specific features such as an API to access the Device Shadow service\. It is distributed as source code and is intended to be built into customer firmware along with application code, other libraries, and RTOS\. For more information, see the following:

+ [AWS IoT Device SDK for Embedded C Readme](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/blob/master/README.md)
+ [AWS IoT Device SDK for Embedded C Porting Guide](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/blob/master/PortingGuide.md)

## AWS IoT C\+\+ Device SDK<a name="iot-cpp-sdk"></a>

The AWS IoT C\+\+ Device SDK allows developers to build connected applications using AWS and the AWS IoT APIs\. Specifically, this SDK was designed for devices that are not resource constrained and require advanced features such as message queuing, multi\-threading support, and the latest language features\. For more information, see the following:

## AWS IoT Device SDK for Java<a name="iot-java-sdk"></a>

The AWS IoT Device SDK for Java makes it possible for Java developers to access the AWS IoT platform through MQTT or MQTT over the WebSocket protocol\. The SDK is built with shadow support\. You can access shadows by using HTTP methods, including GET, UPDATE, and DELETE\. The SDK also supports a simplified shadow access model, which allows developers to exchange data with shadows by just using getter and setter methods, without having to serialize or deserialize any JSON documents\.

+ [AWS IoT Device SDK for Java Readme](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-java/blob/master/README.md)

## AWS IoT Device SDK for JavaScript<a name="iot-javascript-sdk"></a>

The aws\-iot\-device\-sdk\.js package makes it possible for developers to write JavaScript applications that access AWS IoT using MQTT or MQTT over the WebSocket protocol\. It can be used in Node\.js environments and browser applications\. For more information, see the following:
+ [AWS IoT Device SDK for JavaScript on GitHub](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js)
+ [AWS IoT Device SDK for JavaScript Readme](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js/blob/master/README.md)

## AWS IoT Device SDK for Python<a name="iot-python-sdk"></a>

The AWS IoT Device SDK for Python makes it possible for developers to write Python scripts to use their devices to access the AWS IoT platform through MQTT or MQTT over the WebSocket protocol\. By connecting their devices to AWS IoT, users can securely work with the message broker, rules, and shadows provided by AWS IoT and with other AWS services like AWS Lambda, Kinesis, and Amazon S3, and more\.
