## AWS IoT Core services<a name="aws-iot-core-services"></a>

AWS IoT Core provides the services that connect your IoT devices to the AWS Cloud so that other cloud services and applications can interact with your internet\-connected devices\.

![\[A high-level view of AWS IoT Core that shows the device gateway, message broker, rules engine, device shadow, and the other services it provides\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/images/aws_iot_data_services.png)

The next section describes each of the AWS IoT Core services shown in the illustration\.

### AWS IoT Core messaging services<a name="aws-iot-core-connect"></a>

The AWS IoT Core connectivity services provide secure communication with the IoT devices and manage the messages that pass between them and AWS IoT\.

**Device gateway**  
Enables devices to securely and efficiently communicate with AWS IoT\. Device communication is secured by secure protocols that use X\.509 certificates\. 

**Message broker**  
Provides a secure mechanism for devices and AWS IoT applications to publish and receive messages from each other\. You can use either the MQTT protocol directly or MQTT over WebSocket to publish and subscribe\. For more information about the protocols that AWS IoT supports, see [Device communication protocols](protocols.md)\. Devices and clients can also use the HTTP REST interface to publish data to the message broker\.  
The message broker distributes device data to devices that have subscribed to it and to other AWS IoT Core services, such as the Device Shadow service and the rules engine\.

**AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN**  
AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN makes it possible to set up a private LoRaWAN network by connecting your LoRaWAN devices and gateways to AWS without the need to develop and operate a LoRaWAN Network Server \(LNS\)\. Messages received from LoRaWAN devices are sent to the rules engine where they can be formatted and sent to other AWS IoT services\.

**Rules engine**  
The Rules engine connects data from the message broker to other AWS IoT services for storage and additional processing\. For example, you can insert, update, or query a DynamoDB table or invoke a Lambda function based on an expression that you defined in the Rules engine\. You can use an SQL\-based language to select data from message payloads, and then process and send the data to other services, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\), Amazon DynamoDB, and AWS Lambda\. You can also create rules that republish messages to the message broker and on to other subscribers\. For more information, see [Rules for AWS IoT](iot-rules.md)\.

### AWS IoT Core control services<a name="aws-iot-core-control"></a>

The AWS IoT Core control services provide device security, management, and registration features\.

**Custom Authentication service**  
You can define custom authorizers that allow you to manage your own authentication and authorization strategy using a custom authentication service and a Lambda function\. Custom authorizers allow AWS IoT to authenticate your devices and authorize operations using bearer token authentication and authorization strategies\.  
Custom authorizers can implement various authentication strategies; for example, JSON Web Token verification or OAuth provider callout\. They must return policy documents that are used by the device gateway to authorize MQTT operations\. For more information, see [Custom authentication](custom-authentication.md)\.

**Device Provisioning service**  
Allows you to provision devices using a template that describes the resources required for your device: a *thing object*, a certificate, and one or more policies\. A thing object is an entry in the registry that contains attributes that describe a device\. Devices use certificates to authenticate with AWS IoT\. Policies determine which operations a device can perform in AWS IoT\.  
The templates contain variables that are replaced by values in a dictionary \(map\)\. You can use the same template to provision multiple devices just by passing in different values for the template variables in the dictionary\. For more information, see [Device provisioning](iot-provision.md)\.

**Group registry**  
Groups allow you to manage several devices at once by categorizing them into groups\. Groups can also contain groups—you can build a hierarchy of groups\. Any action that you perform on a parent group will apply to its child groups\. The same action also applies to all the devices in the parent group and all devices in the child groups\. Permissions granted to a group will apply to all devices in the group and in all of its child groups\. For more information, see [Managing devices with AWS IoT](iot-thing-management.md)\.

**Jobs service**  
Allows you to define a set of remote operations that are sent to and run on one or more devices connected to AWS IoT\. For example, you can define a job that instructs a set of devices to download and install application or firmware updates, reboot, rotate certificates, or perform remote troubleshooting operations\.  
To create a job, you specify a description of the remote operations to be performed and a list of targets that should perform them\. The targets can be individual devices, groups or both\. For more information, see [Jobs](iot-jobs.md)\.

**Registry**  
Organizes the resources associated with each device in the AWS Cloud\. You register your devices and associate up to three custom attributes with each one\. You can also associate certificates and MQTT client IDs with each device to improve your ability to manage and troubleshoot them\. For more information, see [Managing devices with AWS IoT](iot-thing-management.md)\.

**Security and Identity service**  
Provides shared responsibility for security in the AWS Cloud\. Your devices must keep their credentials safe to securely send data to the message broker\. The message broker and rules engine use AWS security features to send data securely to devices or other AWS services\. For more information, see [Authentication](authentication.md)\.

### AWS IoT Core data services<a name="aws-iot-core-data"></a>

The AWS IoT Core data services help your IoT solutions provide a reliable application experience even with devices that are not always connected\.

**Device shadow**  
A JSON document used to store and retrieve current state information for a device\.

**Device Shadow service**  
The Device Shadow service maintains a device's state so that applications can communicate with a device whether the device is online or not\. When a device is offline, the Device Shadow service manages its data for connected applications\. When the device reconnects, it synchronizes its state with that of its shadow in the Device Shadow service\. Your devices can also publish their current state to a shadow for use by applications or other devices that might not be connected all the time\. For more information, see [AWS IoT Device Shadow service](iot-device-shadows.md)\.

### AWS IoT Core support service<a name="aws-iot-core-integ"></a>

**Alexa Voice Service \(AVS\) Integration for AWS IoT**
