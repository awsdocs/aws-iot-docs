# Creating an AWS IoT rule<a name="iot-create-rule"></a>

You configure rules to route data from your connected things\. Rules consist of the following:

Rule name  
The name of the rule\.  
We do not recommend the use of personally identifiable information in your rule names\.

Optional description  
A textual description of the rule\.  
We do not recommend the use of personally identifiable information in your rule descriptions\.

SQL statement  
A simplified SQL syntax to filter messages received on an MQTT topic and push the data elsewhere\. For more information, see [AWS IoT SQL reference](iot-sql-reference.md)\.

SQL version  
The version of the SQL rules engine to use when evaluating the rule\. Although this property is optional, we strongly recommend that you specify the SQL version\. The AWS IoT Core console sets this property to `2016-03-23` by default\. If this property is not set, such as in an AWS CLI command or an AWS CloudFormation template, `2015-10-08` is used\. For more information, see [SQL versions](iot-rule-sql-version.md)\.

One or more actions  
The actions AWS IoT performs when executing the rule\. For example, you can insert data into a DynamoDB table, write data to an Amazon S3 bucket, publish to an Amazon SNS topic, or invoke a Lambda function\.

An error action  
The action AWS IoT performs when it is unable to perform a rule's action\.

When you create a rule, be aware of how much data you are publishing on topics\. If you create rules that include a wildcard topic pattern, they might match a large percentage of your messages, and you might need to increase the capacity of the AWS resources used by the target actions\. Also, if you create a republish rule that includes a wildcard topic pattern, you can end up with a circular rule that causes an infinite loop\.

**Note**  
Creating and updating rules are administrator\-level actions\. Any user who has permission to create or update rules is able to access data processed by the rules\.

**To create a rule \(AWS CLI\)**  
Use the [create\-topic\-rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iot/create-topic-rule.html) command to create a rule:

```
aws iot create-topic-rule --rule-name myrule --topic-rule-payload file://myrule.json
```

The following is an example payload file with a rule that inserts all messages sent to the `iot/test` topic into the specified DynamoDB table\. The SQL statement filters the messages and the role ARN grants AWS IoT permission to write to the DynamoDB table\.

```
{
  "sql": "SELECT * FROM 'iot/test'",
  "ruleDisabled": false,
  "awsIotSqlVersion": "2016-03-23",
  "actions": [{
      "dynamoDB": {
          "tableName": "my-dynamodb-table",
          "roleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-iot-role",
          "hashKeyField": "topic",
          "hashKeyValue": "${topic(2)}",
          "rangeKeyField": "timestamp",
          "rangeKeyValue": "${timestamp()}"
      }
  }]
}
```

The following is an example payload file with a rule that inserts all messages sent to the `iot/test` topic into the specified S3 bucket\. The SQL statement filters the messages, and the role ARN grants AWS IoT permission to write to the Amazon S3 bucket\.

```
{
  "awsIotSqlVersion": "2016-03-23",
  "sql": "SELECT * FROM 'iot/test'",
  "ruleDisabled": false,
  "actions": [
    {
      "s3": {
        "roleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws_iot_s3",
        "bucketName": "my-bucket",
        "key": "myS3Key"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The following is an example payload file with a rule that pushes data to Amazon OpenSearch Service:

```
{
  "sql":"SELECT *, timestamp() as timestamp FROM 'iot/test'",
  "ruleDisabled":false,
  "awsIotSqlVersion": "2016-03-23",
  "actions":[
    {
      "elasticsearch":{
        "roleArn":"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws_iot_es",
        "endpoint":"https://my-endpoint",
        "index":"my-index",
        "type":"my-type",
        "id":"${newuuid()}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The following is an example payload file with a rule that invokes a Lambda function:

```
{
  "sql": "expression",
  "ruleDisabled": false,
  "awsIotSqlVersion": "2016-03-23",
  "actions": [{
      "lambda": {
          "functionArn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-lambda-function"
      }
  }]
}
```

The following is an example payload file with a rule that publishes to an Amazon SNS topic:

```
{
  "sql": "expression",
  "ruleDisabled": false,
  "awsIotSqlVersion": "2016-03-23",
  "actions": [{
      "sns": {
          "targetArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-sns-topic",
          "roleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-iot-role"
      }
  }]
}
```

The following is an example payload file with a rule that republishes on a different MQTT topic:

```
{
  "sql": "expression",
  "ruleDisabled": false,
  "awsIotSqlVersion": "2016-03-23",
  "actions": [{
      "republish": {
          "topic": "my-mqtt-topic",
          "roleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-iot-role"
      }
  }]
}
```

```
{
  "sql": "SELECT * FROM 'my-topic'",
  "ruleDisabled": false,
  "awsIotSqlVersion": "2016-03-23",
  "actions": [{
      "firehose": {

          "deliveryStreamName": "my-stream-name"
      }
  }]
}
```

The following is an example payload file with a rule that uses the Amazon Machine Learning `machinelearning_predict` function to republish to a topic if the data in the MQTT payload is classified as a 1\.

```
{
  "sql": "SELECT * FROM 'iot/test' where machinelearning_predict('my-model', 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-iot-aml-role', *).predictedLabel=1",
  "ruleDisabled": false,
