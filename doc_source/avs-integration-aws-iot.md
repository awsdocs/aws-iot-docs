# Alexa Voice Service \(AVS\) Integration for AWS IoT<a name="avs-integration-aws-iot"></a>

Alexa Voice Service \(AVS\) Integration for AWS IoT is a new feature that cost\-effectively brings Alexa Voice to any connected device without incurring [messaging costs](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/pricing/)\. AVS for AWS IoT reduces the cost and complexity of integrating Alexa\. This feature leverages AWS IoT to offload intensive computational and memory audio tasks from the device to the cloud\. Because of the resulting reduction in the engineering bill of materials \(eBoM\) cost, device makers can now cost\-effectively bring Alexa to resource\-constrained IoT devices and make it possible for consumers to talk directly to Alexa in parts of their home, office, or hotel rooms for an ambient experience\. 

Currently, smart home IoT devices are built with low\-cost microcontrollers \(MCU\) that have limited memory to run real\-time operating systems\. Previously, AVS solutions for Alexa built\-in products required expensive application processor\-based devices with more than 50 MB memory running on Linux or Android\. These expensive hardware requirements made it cost\-prohibitive to integrate Alexa Voice on resource\-constrained IoT devices\. AVS for AWS IoT enables Alexa built\-in functionality on MCUs, such as the Arm Cortex\-M series processors with less than 1 MB embedded RAM\. To do so, AVS offloads memory and compute tasks to a virtual Alexa built\-in device in the cloud\. This reduces eBoM cost by up to 50 percent\.

For more information about the Arm Cortex\-M series processors, see [Arm](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/processors/cortex-m) or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-M)\. For more information about hardware requirements for Alexa built\-in products, see [Sizing Up CPU, Memory, and Storage for Your Alexa Built\-in Device](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2018/09/cpu-memory-and-storage-for-alexa-built-in-dev) on the Amazon Alexa developer portal\.

**Note**  
AVS for AWS IoT is available in all AWS Regions where AWS IoT is available except in the China \(Beijing and Ningxia\) Regions\. For the current list of AWS Regions, see the [AWS Region Table](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)\.

AVS for AWS IoT has three components:
+ A set of reserved MQTT topics to transfer audio messages between Alexa enabled devices and AVS\.
+ A virtual Alexa enabled device in the cloud that shifts tasks related to media retrieval, audio decoding, audio mixing, and state management from the physical device to the virtual device\.
+ A set of APIs that support receiving and sending messages over the reserved topics, interfacing with the device microphone and speaker, and managing device state\.

The following diagram illustrates how these components work together\. It also demonstrates how device makers use the Login with Amazon to service to authenticate AVS\.

The Alexa Voice service sends MQTT messages to an Alexa enabled device through AWS IoT.

Device manufacturers have two options to get started with AVS Integration for AWS IoT \. 
+ **Development kits** – Development kits launched by our partners make it easy to get started\. The [NXP i\.MX RT 106 A](https://www.nxp.com/design/designs/mcu-based-solution-for-br-alexa-voice-service:MCU-VOICE-CONTROL-AVS), [Qualcomm Home Hub 100 Development Kit for Amazon AVS](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/qualcomm-home-hub-100-dev-kit-amazon-avs), and [STM32 STEVAL\-VOICE\-UI](https://www.st.com/en/solutions-reference-designs/sl-vui-cloud-01.html#2) are some of the kits available on the market\. You can find them on [Development Kits for AVS](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-voice-service/dev-kits)\. The kits include out\-of\-the box connectivity to AWS IoT, AVS qualified Audio Algorithms for Far\-Field voice pickup, Echo Cancellation, Alexa Wake Word, and AVS for AWS IoT application code\. You can use the feature application code to quickly prototype a device and port the implementation to your chosen MCU design for testing and device production when you're ready\.
+ **Custom device\-side application code** – Developers can also write a custom AVS for AWS IoT application by using the publicly available API\. Documentation for this API is available on the [AVS developer page](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-voice-service/avs-for-aws-iot-overview.html)\. You can download the FreeRTOS and AWS IoT Device SDK from the FreeRTOS console \([https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/freertos/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/freertos/)\) or [GitHub](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos)\.
